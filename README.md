# AntiTheft

An advanced AntiTheft system designed to protect your laptop, deter unauthorized access, and assist in recovering your lost device quickly.

## Overview

**AntiTheft** captures crucial evidence like images, audio, and video of anyone attempting unauthorized access to your system by entering a wrong password. It also sends location details and alerts to your email, ensuring you remain informed about any intrusion attempts.

## Features

- **Capture Evidence**: Automatically records the intruder's image, audio, and video upon a wrong password attempt.
- **Location Tracking**: Retrieves and sends the system's location using hardware-level GPS (if available).
- **Alert Notifications**: Sends email alerts containing captured media and location information.
- **Automated Execution**: Script activates when the system locks and stops when it unlocks.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust mechanisms to handle runtime issues and ensure reliable operation.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Gmail App Password** for sending email notifications.
- **Additional Libraries**: Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

   - Schedule the script to run automatically when your system locks using the Windows Task Scheduler.

## Usage

1. Ensure the script is configured and running in the background or set up as a scheduled task.
2. On a wrong password attempt:
   - The system captures the intruder's image, audio, and video.
   - An alert email is sent to your registered email with the collected evidence and the system's location.

## Logs

All events and errors are logged for monitoring and troubleshooting. Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory.

## Future Enhancements

- **Customizable UI**: Enable users to personalize alert preferences and other settings through a graphical interface.
- **More functionality** To prevents further access to system if wrong password is provided, continue mail attempts if failed. 
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve messaging and response times for better user experience.
